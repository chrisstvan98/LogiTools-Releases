<div class="motd-section-title">Hey there! Logical here!</div>
<p>First of all, I appreciate you downloading and installing these tools. It's something that I've been working on recently and it means a lot to me that you've shown support and believing in what I'm making. I think it's something truly special and can help a lot of people make cool stuff for their maps!</p>
<p>All of the templates, models, scripts, fx, etc. for all of the selections in all of the tools are <span class="motd-highlight">100% original</span> and made/written by myself. I wanted this to be truly something special so I've made everything from the ground up to ensure that you can have the most freedom in generating whatever you wish for your maps, and it'll just work.</p>
<p>I'm posting updates and stuff within the DEVRAW Discord, mostly in the Supporters Chat for now since this isn't "PUBLIC", at least not yet! If you wish to join <em>(for whatever reason you aren't in it yet)</em>, click this link: <a href="https://discord.gg/3YaDCAP4Tw">https://discord.gg/3YaDCAP4Tw</a></p>
<p>Thank you again for your support and just downloading and trying out the tool. This also couldn't have been made without the DEVRAW Team, specifically <strong>proventus</strong> and <strong>shiddy</strong>. They are the backbone of our community and strive to make DEVRAW the best place to be for all things mod tools.</p>
<p><strong>Have fun, Happy Modding!</strong></p>
